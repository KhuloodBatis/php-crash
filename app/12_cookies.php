 Cookies are small pieces of data that a web server sends to a user's web browser and are stored on the user's device.
  They are commonly used to maintain user sessions, store user preferences, and track user activities on a website.

In PHP, you can work with cookies using the $_COOKIE superglobal array. When a user visits a website,
 the web server can send cookies to the user's browser using the setcookie() function in PHP. Here's the basic syntax of the setcookie() function:

php
Copy code
setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure, httponly);
Save to grepper
Let's go through each parameter:

name: The name of the cookie (string).
value: The value of the cookie (string).
expire: The expiration time of the cookie. It's a Unix timestamp, and the cookie will be deleted after this time. If not set, the cookie will expire when the browser session ends.
path: The path on the server where the cookie will be available. If set to '/', the cookie will be available across the entire domain.
domain: The domain where the cookie will be available. Use 'www.example.com' instead of 'example.com' to make the cookie available only to the 'www' subdomain.
secure: If set to true, the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS connections.
httponly: If set to true, the cookie will be accessible only through the HTTP protocol, and not through JavaScript.
To retrieve the value of a cookie, you can access the $_COOKIE superglobal array like this:

php
Copy code
$value = $_COOKIE['cookiename'];
Save to grepper
Here's a simple example of setting and retrieving a cookie in PHP:

php
Copy code
<?php
// Set a cookie that expires in one hour
setcookie('username', 'JohnDoe', time() + 3600);

// Retrieving the value of the cookie
if (isset($_COOKIE['username'])) {
    $username = $_COOKIE['username'];
    echo "Welcome back, $username!";
} else {
    echo "Welcome, guest!";
}
?>
Save to grepper
Remember that cookies are stored on the user's device, so they can be modified or deleted by the user. 
Therefore, you should avoid storing sensitive information in cookies. For more secure data storage, consider using sessions or other server-side methods.
